So you have secured data :tada: for your model and trained it with `model.train`, and maybe you have evaluate its performance on a hold-out test set or potential done an `A/B-test`. However, how do you know that your model will work, when deployed? 

Can you ensure that your model still works after some slight changes in input data? In this article we will cover some considerations for how you can test your ML system to mitigate and take any relevant actions before and after you have deployed your model. 

This post has been inspired by some previous work such as:

* :computer: [Effective testing for machine learning systems](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/testing-ml/)
