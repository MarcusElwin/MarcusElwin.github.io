[FIA Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/) is the ultimate combination of <cite>fast cars [^1]</cite>, the latest techology and eccentric drivers and team principals. Not to far off from the "normal" business environment :sweat_smile: at a tech startup or scale-up. Me like many other people where probably not big F1 fans until we saw [Formula 1 Drive To Survie](https://www.netflix.com/se-en/title/80204890) on Netflix a couple of years back. 

As of now in the middle of the 2023 session, there are [10](https://www.formula1.com/en/teams.html) Formula 1 teams competing with *Redbull Racing* leading the *constructors* championship followed by *Mercedes* and *Aston Martion* on second and third position. Red-bull is clearly enjoying the :crown: with their super star [Max Verstapen](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen). But is all credit due to him, for their great success in the 2023 session?

In this blog post we will dig in to the inner workings of a F1 team, data products team and what similarities there are, to finally conclude on some learnings data product teams can take from F1.

## How is a F1 team organized?  

### Typical roles in a F1 team

| Role   | Role Description     | # People   |
| --------  | -------- | ------ |
| Team Principal | __TODO__ | 1 |
| F1 Drivers | __TODO__ | 2 |
| Assistants | __TODO__ | 4-12 |
| Managers | __TODO__ | 10-20 |
| Engineers | __TODO__ | 51-211+|
| Designers | __TODO__ | 44-120|
| Mechanics | __TODO__ | 20+|
| Production | __TODO__ | 8-90|
| Other | __TODO__ | 20-90|

The table above shows a rough grouping of different **9** common roles in a Formula 1 team. Depending on the size of the team normally ~170-600 people are involved in operating a Formula 1 team. Below follows an overview of what each person is in charge of:

* *Team Principal*: The directors of the team, some may come from car manufactors or other are from private companies from the team owners.

* *F1 Drivers*: The stars of the team driving the F1 cars. Normally there is 1 reserve driver and 1 simulation driver.

* *Assistants*: They are in charge of helping and organzing events, calendars and procedures.

* *Managers*: In charge of different groups and areas, leading teams, supervising and guiding.

* *Engineers*: Many different rules such as *race engineers*, *aerodynamics engineers* and *R&D engineers*. They make shit work. 

* *Designers*: Handle everything covering the design of the cars.

* *Mechanics*: What we normally see during the races, they change and repair components when the F1 drivers fucks up.

* *Production*: Responsible for producing and developing car parts.

* *Other*: Chefs, personal trainers,  web and media relations etc.

More and more teams also employs data competencies such as *Data Scientist*, *Data Engineers*, *Analytics Engineers* to make the teams more successful in wind tunnel similations for aerodynamics, making sense of waste amounts of IoT data and even improving the team strategies.

### Typical roles in a Data Products Team
| Role   | Role Description     | # People   |
| --------  | -------- | ------ |
| Area Leads / Engineering Directors | __TODO__ | 1 - 4 |
| Engineering Managers | __TODO__ | 1-2 |
| Product Managers | __TODO__ | 1-3 |
| Data Scientists | __TODO__ | 3-5 |
| Backend / Frontend Engineers | __TODO__ | 5-10|
| Designers | __TODO__ | 1-2|
| Other | __TODO__ | 5-10|

* *Area Leads / Engineering Directors*: The directors of the team setting the high level vision and agenda based on the company objectives. Depending on company CTO might take some of these roles as well or VP of Engineering.

* *Engineering Managers*: Responsible for coaching, mentoring and developing the team and improving the execution of things. Often fascinated with reducing **"technical debt"**. Some more Data Science focused companies might have a variant called *Data Science Manager*.

* *Product Managers*: Responsible for the vision and roadmap for what to build in the team. Often teams gateway to clients. They are in the sweat spoot of having no *formal power*, but need to get people and other teams aligned and do what they want.

* *Data Scientists*: Data wizards, Data Wranglers that make magic happen with data. *ML*, *LLMs* & *AI* are buzzwords they use. Often in charge of building algorithms and or product logic, but not always deploying (many favor *jupyter notebooks*) them depending on the company. Also some companies might call them *AI Engineers*, *ML Engineer* or even *Generative AI Engineer* these days. You might also have seen [Decision Scientist](https://chds.hsph.harvard.edu/approaches/what-is-decision-science/) pop up in some companies. What they do differently from Data Scientist is still an unsolved mystery.

* *Backend / Frontend Engineers*: Engineers skilled in building backend or frontend systems, APIs, infrastructure via terraform and reducing **technical debt** (which is why they get along with the EM). If you are fortunate you may have some *full-stack* engineers in your team that can do both. Not like wizards, bit more like swizz knifes.

* *Designers*: People skilled in figma and designing flows and user journeys. Often these tend to be outside of the product team, so if you have one don't let them leave.

* *Other*: Usually people labelling data, most often students needing money :moneybag:.
