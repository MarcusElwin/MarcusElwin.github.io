Welcome to my blog, here I will share my thoughts on building *data products* using ML and Data Science. Everything I share here are my own opinions and do not reflect the opinions of the companies I have been working for.

## Who am I?

I'm a tech and people interested recovering data scientist turned product manager. I am also a big fan of food :pizza: (*foodie*) and music (I play bass guitar :guitar: in a band).

## My Experience

I'm a Senior Data Scientist turned Product Manager, living in Stockholm, :flag-se: that have been working with Data Science, Machine Learning and ML Systems for the past 5+ years in a mix of companies and industries ranging from *retail* to *fintech*. NLP and LLMs are some of my current focus areas as well as learning the ropes of *product management*.

I also have experience from other types of ML use cases such as: 
* Demand forecasting, 
* Time series analysis, 
* Churn prediction, 
* Optimization
* Reinforcement Learning for Trading
* Customer segmentation. 

I'm currently employed at [Tink](https://tink.com/), where I work with enriching open banking data (PSD2) for risk use cases, using Machine Learning and Data Science techniques. Python, SQL (big fan of *BigQuery*) are my go-to tools :tools: , but I do occasionally use other languages such as Java.
